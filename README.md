# What is it?

PicGuy is an open source photo administration software, like Shotwell and Picasa, that can do batch editing

# What it will do?

Will allow you to split the photos you have in groups, tag them, and (possibly) send them to Internet, by email or to sites like Flickr, G+ and Facebook.

It will allow you to do basic edition, like:
* Rotate and resize
* Crop
* Add text
* Add watermark
* Change hue, brightness and contrast

in _multiple images_ at once.

Will support JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and possibly TIFF and RAW images.

It uses GTK 3 to build the graphical interface.

# Dependencies

* libpng (PNG support)
* libjpeg-turbo (JPEG support)
* GTK 3.10
