==============

# What is it?

PicGuy is an open source photo administration software, like Shotwell and Picasa.

# What it will do?

Will allow you to split the photos you have in groups, tag them, and (possibly) send them to Internet, by email or to sites like Flickr, G+ and Facebook.

Will support JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and possibly TIFF and RAW images.

It uses GTK 3.0 to build the graphical interface.
