PicGuy
==============

What is it?
==========
PicGuy is an open source photo administration software, like Shotwell and Picasa.

What it will do?
====================
Will allow you to split the photos you have in groups, tag them, and (possibly) send them to Internet, by email or to sites like Flickr, G+ and Facebook.

Will support JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and possibly TIFF and RAW images.

I haven't decided if it will use GTK or Qt. Probably GTK.
